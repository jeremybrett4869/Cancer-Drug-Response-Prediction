# Cancer Drug Response Prediction
 
This project aims to develop clinically applicable tools using representation learning and modelling techniques of cancer cell lines to provide useful interpretation of personalised genomic profiles, examine the joint effect of genomic aberrations on drug efficacy, and recommend potentially effective drugs. The data used in this study is restricted to the genes available in the FoundationOne report used in the hospital setting, covering multi-omic profiles of 692 cell lines and drug sensitivity data of 385 drugs.
